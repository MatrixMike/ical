Error: While constructing the build plan, the following exceptions were encountered:

In the dependencies for time-1.4.2:
    deepseq-1.4.3.0 from stack configuration does not match >=1.1 && <1.4  (latest matching version is 1.3.0.2)
needed due to ical-0.0.1 -> time-1.4.2

Some different approaches to resolving this:

  * Set 'allow-newer: true' to ignore all version constraints and build anyway.

  * Consider trying 'stack solver', which uses the cabal-install solver to attempt to find some working build configuration. This can
    be convenient when dealing with many complicated constraint errors, but results may be unpredictable.

  * Recommended action: try adding the following to your extra-deps in /home/mikeh/ical/stack.yaml:

- deepseq-1.3.0.2

Plan construction failed.
